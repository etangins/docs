## Overview
The Martian router system helps you optimize your LLM usage by intelligently routing requests to the most appropriate model based on your requirements. In this guide, we'll build a translation service that demonstrates how the system works. The system consists of two main components:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Routers" icon="route">
    Direct each translation request to the optimal model based on cost or quality requirements. For example, routing casual conversations to faster, cheaper models while using higher-quality models for legal document translation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Judges" icon="gavel">
    Define and measure translation quality metrics that routers optimize for, such as accuracy, fluency, and preservation of tone.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

  ```mermaid
  graph LR
    A[Translation Request] --> B[Router]
    B --> C{Select Model}
    C --> D[GPT-4<br/>High Accuracy<br/>Higher Cost]
    C --> E[GPT-3.5<br/>Good Accuracy<br/>Lower Cost]
    C --> F[Other Models<br/>Basic Translation<br/>Minimal Cost]
    D --> G[Translation]

## Key Features
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Intelligent Routing">
    Automatically select the best translation model based on your specific needs. For casual conversation, a faster, cheaper model might be sufficient, while legal document translation might require higher accuracy.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cost Optimization">
    Set cost constraints to get the best possible translation quality within your budget. For example, maintain a specific cost-per-word while maximizing accuracy.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Quality Control">
    Define translation quality metrics and ensure responses meet your standards for accuracy, fluency, and tone preservation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Continuous Improvement">
    Learn from user feedback about translation quality to make better routing decisions over time.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Follow our step-by-step guide to:
1. Set up your environment
2. Create a translation quality judge
3. Create a router for handling translations
4. Start routing translation requests
5. Monitor and optimize translation performance

## Understanding Translation Judges
A judge is the cornerstone of the Martian system. For translation tasks, it defines what makes a "good" translation and provides consistent quality metrics that guide routing decisions.

  <Card title="Quality Definition" icon="star">
    Judges evaluate translation quality based on accuracy, fluency, and tone preservation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Feedback Loop" icon="rotate">
    Provides feedback to help routers select the most appropriate translation model
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Creating Your First Judge
<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize Judge Creation">
    ```python
    from config import API_URL, ORG_ID, HEADERS
    import requests

    url = f'{API_URL}/org/{ORG_ID}/judges'
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Judge Parameters">
    ```python
    data = {
        'name': 'korean-english-judge',
        'description': 'Evaluates translation quality between Korean and English'
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Judge">
    ```python
    response = requests.post(url, headers=HEADERS, json=data)
    judge_id = response.json()['judge_id']
    print(f"Created translation judge with ID: {judge_id}")
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verifying Judge Creation
After creating a judge, verify its details:
```python
def get_judge_details(judge_id: str):
    """Retrieve details about a specific translation judge."""
    url = f'{API_URL}/org/{ORG_ID}/judges/{judge_id}'
    response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS)
    return response.json()

details = get_judge_details(judge_id)
print(f"Name: {details['name']}")
print(f"Description: {details['description']}")
print(f"Created at: {details['created_at']}")
print(f"Latest version: {details['latest']}")
```

## Managing Multiple Judges
If you're handling different language pairs or quality metrics, you might create multiple judges:
```python
def list_judges():
    """List all translation judges in your organization."""
    url = f'{API_URL}/org/{ORG_ID}/judges'
    response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS)
    return response.json()['judges']

judges = list_judges()
for judge in judges:
    print(f"\nID: {judge['judge_id']}")
    print(f"Name: {judge['name']}")
    print(f"Description: {judge['description']}")
```

## Best Practices
### Naming Conventions
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Descriptive Names">
    Use names that clearly indicate the judge's purpose:
    - `korean-english-judge`
    - `business-translation-judge`
    - `technical-translation-judge`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Detailed Descriptions">
    Include in your description:
    - Language pairs supported
    - Target quality metrics
    - Specific use cases (e.g., business, technical, casual)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Quality Metrics
Consider these factors when evaluating translations:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Accuracy" icon="bullseye">
    How accurately is the meaning preserved?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fluency" icon="pen-fancy">
    How natural does the translation read?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tone" icon="comment">
    Is the tone/style maintained appropriately?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context" icon="scroll">
    Is cultural context preserved where needed?
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Issues
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Duplicate Names">
    Each judge must have a unique name. For multiple language pairs, consider names like:
    - `ko-en-formal-judge`
    - `ko-en-casual-judge`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Invalid Characters">
    Judge names should only contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing Description">
    Include specific details about which language pairs and quality metrics the judge evaluates.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next Steps
Now that you've created a translation judge, you can:
1. Create a router that uses your judge
2. Start evaluating translations
3. Store and analyze translation quality
4. Update quality metrics based on user feedback

<Note>
  For optimal routing performance, ensure your judge consistently evaluates similar translations with similar scores.

Adding a Martian router to your application is as simple as changing a single parameter. Let's see how to modify our translation app to use intelligent model selection.

## Create Your First Router
First, create a router (this only needs to be done once):

```python
from martian import Router

# Create a router
router = Router.create(
    name="translation-router",
    description="Routes translation requests to optimal models"
    baseline="gpt-4o"
)

# Save this router ID for your application
print(f"Created router with ID: {router.id}")
```

It's important to set the baseline to the existing model you are using to generate the maximum quality improvement and cost reduction achievable. You will be able to showcase your performance improvement to others later on.

## Use the Router
Simply update your model parameter to use the router:

```python
def translate(text):
    """Translate text between Korean and English with automatic model selection."""
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="translation-router",  # Just change this one line to the name you used when creating a router to use your router
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a skilled Korean-English translator."},
            {"role": "user", "content": text}
        ]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()

# Example usage
result = translate("안녕하세요")
print(f"Translation: {result}")
```

That's it! Your application now has intelligent model selection. The router will automatically:
- Select appropriate models for each request
- Optimize for both cost and quality
- Improve its selections over time based on feedback

<Note>
  You don't need to set up a judge or provide feedback to start using a router. Those features can be added later to further optimize performance.

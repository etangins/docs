While cost optimization provides immediate benefits, you can further improve your router's performance using quality constraints and feedback.

## Using Quality Constraints
Instead of specifying a cost, you can request a minimum quality level:

```python
def translate(text, quality=None):
    router = Router(router_id="your_router_id")
    
    response = router.completions.create(
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a skilled Korean-English translator."},
            {"role": "user", "content": text}
        ],
        quality=quality  # Minimum quality score (0-1)
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()

# Request high-quality translation
result = translate("법적 문서입니다.", quality=0.9)
```

## Quality Scores and Feedback
The quality parameter becomes more powerful as you provide feedback. When you tell Martian about translation quality, it learns to:
- Predict which models perform best for different content types
- Select models that consistently meet your quality requirements
- Balance quality and cost effectively

```python
# Example showing quality-based routing
translations = [
    translate("안녕하세요", quality=0.7),          # Casual conversation
    translate("제품 설명서입니다.", quality=0.8),    # Product documentation
    translate("계약서 내용입니다.", quality=0.95)    # Legal content
]
```

## Automatic Improvement
As you provide feedback (covered in the next section), your router automatically:
- Learns from translation quality ratings
- Improves model selection accuracy
- Creates new versions with better performance
- Updates its quality predictions

<Note>
  While you can use quality constraints immediately, they become more effective as you provide feedback about translation quality. The router uses this feedback to continuously improve its model selection.

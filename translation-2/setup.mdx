Let's add Martian to your application. This involves a simple installation and changing only a few lines of code.

## Installation

```bash
pip install martian-routing python-dotenv
```

## Configuration
Create a `.env` file with your Martian API key:

```env
MARTIAN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Test Your Setup
Create a `test_setup.py` file to verify your configuration:

```python test_setup.py
from openai import OpenAI
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Configure client with Martian
client = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.getenv("MARTIAN_API_KEY"),
    base_url="https://api.withmartian.com/v1/completions"
)

def translate(text):
    """Translate text between Korean and English."""
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",  # Now using Claude through Martian
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": """You are a highly skilled translator with expertise in many languages. Your task is to:
                - Identify if the input is Korean or English
                - If Korean, translate to English
                - If English, translate to Korean
                - Preserve meaning, tone, and nuance
                - Maintain proper grammar and formality level
                """},
            {"role": "user", "content": text}
        ]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()

# Test the setup
if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = translate("Hello, how are you?")
    print(f"\nTranslation: {result}")
```

That's it! With these simple changes, you're now ready to use Martian. In the next sections, we'll explore how to optimize your application using Martian's routing capabilities.

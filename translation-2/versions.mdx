As you provide feedback, Martian automatically creates new versions of your router with improved performance. Here's how to work with versions effectively.

## Using the Latest Version
By default, you'll want to use the latest version to get the best performance:

```python
router = Router(
    router_id="your_router_id",
    version="latest"  # Always use most recent improvements
)
```

## Viewing Available Versions
You can see all versions of your router:

```python
router = Router(router_id="your_router_id")
versions = router.list_versions()

for version in versions:
    print(f"Version ID: {version.id}")
    print(f"Created: {version.created_at}")
```

## Using Specific Versions
For production environments, you might want to use a specific version:

```python
# Use a specific version
router = Router(
    router_id="your_router_id",
    version="version_id"  # Lock to specific version
)
```

<Note>
  In most cases, using `version="latest"` is recommended as it automatically incorporates improvements from your feedback. Use specific versions when you need consistent behavior in production.

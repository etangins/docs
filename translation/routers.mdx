## Understanding Translation Routers
Routers are intelligent decision-makers that select the optimal model for each translation request. They use judge feedback to balance translation quality with cost.

    Route translations to meet quality requirements at minimum cost

    Ensure translations meet quality standards defined by judges
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Creating Your First Router
<Note>
  Before creating a router, you need a judge ID from the previous step to evaluate translation quality.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize Router Creation">
    ```python
    from config import API_URL, ORG_ID, HEADERS
    import requests

    url = f'{API_URL}/org/{ORG_ID}/routers'
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Router Parameters">
    ```python
    data = {
        'name': 'korean-english-router',
        'description': 'Routes Korean-English translation requests based on quality needs',
        'judge_id': 'your_judge_id_here',
        'baseline_model': 'gpt-4'  # High-quality baseline for translations
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Router">
    ```python
    response = requests.post(url, headers=HEADERS, json=data)
    router_id = response.json()['router_id']
    print(f"Created translation router with ID: {router_id}")
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verifying Router Creation
After creating a router, verify its details:
```python
def get_router_details(router_id: str):
    """Retrieve details about a specific translation router."""
    url = f'{API_URL}/org/{ORG_ID}/routers/{router_id}'
    response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS)
    return response.json()

details = get_router_details(router_id)
print(f"Name: {details['name']}")
print(f"Description: {details['description']}")
print(f"Judge ID: {details['judge_id']}")
print(f"Baseline Model: {details['baseline_model']}")
print(f"Created at: {details['created_at']}")
```

## Understanding Router Constraints
Routers accept two types of constraints for translation requests:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cost Constraints" icon="dollar-sign">
    ```python
    # Numeric value (dollars)
    constraint = {'cost': 0.1}
    
    # Model name
    constraint = {'cost': 'gpt-3.5-turbo'}
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="Quality Constraints" icon="chart-line">
    ```python
    # Numeric value (0-1)
    constraint = {'quality': 0.8}
    
    # Model name
    constraint = {'quality': 'gpt-4'}
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Managing Multiple Routers
List all your translation routers:
```python
def list_routers():
    """List all translation routers in your organization."""
    url = f'{API_URL}/org/{ORG_ID}/routers'
    response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS)
    return response.json()['routers']

routers = list_routers()
for router in routers:
    print(f"\nID: {router['router_id']}")
    print(f"Name: {router['name']}")
    print(f"Description: {router['description']}")
```

## Understanding Baseline Models
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is a Baseline Model?">
    The baseline model serves as:
    - A quality benchmark for translations
    - A fallback option when unsure
    - A starting point for optimization
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Choosing a Baseline">
    Common choices for translation:
    - `gpt-4`: High accuracy, better cultural understanding
    - `gpt-3.5-turbo`: Good balance of quality and speed
    - `gpt-4-turbo`: Latest model with improved capabilities
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Translation Cost-Quality Trade-offs
Routers optimize the trade-off between cost and translation quality:
<Frame>
  ```mermaid
  scatter
    title Cost vs Quality Trade-off for Translation
    x-axis Quality [0-1]
    y-axis Cost ($)
    line-0: 0.7,0.02 "Basic Translation"
    line-1: 0.85,0.06 "Business Quality"
    line-2: 0.95,0.12 "Professional Quality"
  ```
</Frame>

## Best Practices
### Router Configuration
<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Appropriate Baseline">
    Select a baseline model that matches your minimum translation quality requirements
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Clear Objectives">
    Decide whether to optimize for:
    - Minimum cost with acceptable accuracy
    - Maximum accuracy for important documents
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Performance">
    Regularly check:
    - Translation accuracy
    - Response times
    - Cost efficiency
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Constraint Selection

    - Translating casual content
    - High volume of translations
    - Speed is important
  </Card>
  <Card title="Quality-Based Routing" icon="ranking-star">
    Use when:
    - Translating legal documents
    - Professional content
    - Perfect accuracy needed
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Issues
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid Judge ID">
    Ensure the judge_id exists and is configured for the correct language pair.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Invalid Baseline Model">
    Use only supported model names for the baseline_model parameter.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Duplicate Names">
    Router names must be unique. Consider names like:
    - `ko-en-business-router`
    - `ko-en-technical-router`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next Steps
Now that you've created a translation router, you can:
1. Test routing with different constraints
2. Monitor translation quality
3. Store and analyze translations
4. Add quality judgements for optimization

<Note>
  Remember to record your router_id for use in translation requests.

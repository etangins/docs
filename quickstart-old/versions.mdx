## Version Overview

Both routers and judges use versioning to track changes and improvements over time. Understanding version management is crucial for maintaining stable performance.

## Judge Versions

### Listing Judge Versions

<CodeGroup>
```python List Versions
# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

def list_judge_versions(judge_id: str):
    """List all versions of a specific judge."""
    url = f'{os.getenv("MARTIAN_API_URL")}/org/{os.getenv("MARTIAN_ORG_ID")}/judges/{judge_id}/versions'
    
    headers = {
        'accept': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {os.getenv("MARTIAN_API_KEY")}'
    }
    
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    versions = response.json()
    
    for version in versions['versions']:
        print(f"\nVersion ID: {version['version_id']}")
        print(f"Created at: {version['created_at']}")
        print(f"Slug: {version['slug']}")
        print(f"IAA Score: {version['iaa']}")
    
    return versions
```

```python Get Version Details
def get_judge_version_details(judge_id: str, version_id: str):
    """Get detailed information about a specific judge version."""
    url = f'{os.getenv("MARTIAN_API_URL")}/org/{os.getenv("MARTIAN_ORG_ID")}/judges/{judge_id}/versions/{version_id}'
    
    headers = {
        'accept': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {os.getenv("MARTIAN_API_KEY")}'
    }
    
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    version = response.json()
    
    print(f"\nVersion Details:")
    print(f"Version ID: {version['version_id']}")
    print(f"Created at: {version['created_at']}")
    print(f"Slug: {version['slug']}")
    print(f"Hash: {version['hash']}")
    print(f"IAA Score: {version['iaa']}")
    
    return version
```
</CodeGroup>

### Understanding Judge Version Details

Each judge version includes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Version ID" icon="fingerprint">
    Unique identifier for the version
  </Card>
  <Card title="Created Timestamp" icon="clock">
    When the version was created
  </Card>
  <Card title="Slug" icon="tag">
    Human-readable identifier
  </Card>
  <Card title="IAA Score" icon="chart-simple">
    Inter-Annotator Agreement score
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Router Versions

### Listing Router Versions

<CodeGroup>
```python List Versions
def list_router_versions(router_id: str):
    """List all versions of a specific router."""
    url = f'{os.getenv("MARTIAN_API_URL")}/org/{os.getenv("MARTIAN_ORG_ID")}/routers/{router_id}/versions'
    
    headers = {
        'accept': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {os.getenv("MARTIAN_API_KEY")}'
    }
    
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    versions = response.json()
    
    for version in versions['versions']:
        print(f"\nVersion ID: {version['version_id']}")
        print(f"Created at: {version['created_at']}")
        print(f"Slug: {version['slug']}")
        print(f"Judge Version ID: {version['judge_version_id']}")
    
    return versions
```

```python Get Version Details
def get_router_version_details(router_id: str, version_id: str):
    """Get detailed information about a specific router version."""
    url = f'{os.getenv("MARTIAN_API_URL")}/org/{os.getenv("MARTIAN_ORG_ID")}/routers/{router_id}/versions/{version_id}'
    
    headers = {
        'accept': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {os.getenv("MARTIAN_API_KEY")}'
    }
    
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    version = response.json()
    
    print(f"\nVersion Details:")
    print(f"Version ID: {version['version_id']}")
    print(f"Created at: {version['created_at']}")
    print(f"Slug: {version['slug']}")
    print(f"Hash: {version['hash']}")
    print(f"Judge Version ID: {version['judge_version_id']}")
    
    print("\nCost-Quality Points:")
    for point in version['cost_quality_points']:
        print(f"Cost: ${point['cost']:.4f}, Quality: {point['quality']:.4f}")
    
    return version
```
</CodeGroup>

### Understanding Router Version Details

Each router version includes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Version ID" icon="fingerprint">
    Unique identifier for the version
  </Card>
  <Card title="Created Timestamp" icon="clock">
    When the version was created
  </Card>
  <Card title="Judge Version ID" icon="link">
    Associated judge version
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cost-Quality Points" icon="chart-scatter">
    Performance metrics
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Version Management

### Creating a Version Manager

Here's a utility class to help manage versions:

```python
class VersionManager:
    def __init__(self):
        load_dotenv()
        self.api_url = os.getenv("MARTIAN_API_URL")
        self.org_id = os.getenv("MARTIAN_ORG_ID")
        self.headers = {
            'accept': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': f'Bearer {os.getenv("MARTIAN_API_KEY")}'
        }

    def get_latest_versions(self, judge_id: str, router_id: str):
        """Get the latest versions for a judge-router pair."""
        judge_versions = self.list_judge_versions(judge_id)
        router_versions = self.list_router_versions(router_id)
        
        latest_judge = judge_versions['versions'][0] if judge_versions['versions'] else None
        latest_router = router_versions['versions'][0] if router_versions['versions'] else None
        
        return {
            'judge': latest_judge,
            'router': latest_router
        }

    def find_compatible_versions(self, judge_id: str, router_id: str):
        """Find all compatible judge and router version pairs."""
        judge_versions = self.list_judge_versions(judge_id)
        router_versions = self.list_router_versions(router_id)
        
        compatible_pairs = []
        for router_version in router_versions['versions']:
            judge_version_id = router_version['judge_version_id']
            matching_judge = next(
                (j for j in judge_versions['versions'] if j['version_id'] == judge_version_id),
                None
            )
            if matching_judge:
                compatible_pairs.append({
                    'judge_version': matching_judge,
                    'router_version': router_version
                })
        
        return compatible_pairs
```

## Best Practices

### Version Management

<Steps>
  <Step title="Track Version Pairs">
    Maintain records of which judge and router versions work well together
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Performance">
    Track performance metrics across versions to identify improvements or regressions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Document Changes">
    Keep clear records of changes and improvements in each version
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Production Usage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Version Stability">
    - Use specific version IDs in production
    - Test new versions before deployment
    - Keep track of version compatibility
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Performance Monitoring">
    - Monitor cost-quality metrics across versions
    - Track IAA scores for judge versions
    - Compare performance between versions
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Version Updates">
    - Plan version updates carefully
    - Test new versions in staging
    - Maintain rollback procedures
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Issues

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Version Not Found" icon="circle-exclamation">
    ```python
    404: Version ID doesn't exist or was deleted
    ```
    Verify version ID exists and is still active
  </Card>
  <Card title="Incompatible Versions" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    ```python
    422: Judge version not compatible
    ```
    Ensure judge and router versions are compatible
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Next Steps

After understanding versions, you can:
1. Start using specific versions in production
2. Monitor version performance
3. Plan version updates
4. Manage version compatibility

<Note>
  Always test new versions thoroughly before deploying them to production.

Adding a Martian router to your application is as simple as changing a single parameter. Let's see how to modify our translation app to use intelligent model selection.

Let's create a new file called `create_router.py`

## Create Your First Router

First, create a router (this only needs to be done once):

```python create_router.py
# Initialize Router Creation
from config import API_URL, ORG_ID, HEADERS
import requests

url = f'{API_URL}/org/{ORG_ID}/routers'

# Define Router Parameters
data = {
  'name': 'translation-router', # This is the name of your router
  'description': 'Routes Korean-English translation requests based on quality needs',
  'baseline_model': 'gpt-4o-mini'  # The model you currently use for the application
}

# Create Router
response = requests.post(url, headers=HEADERS, json=data)
router_id = response.json()['router_id']
print(f"Created translation router with ID: {router_id}")
```

It's important to set the baseline to the existing model you are using to generate the maximum quality improvement and cost reduction achievable. You will be able to showcase your performance improvement to others later on.

## Use the Router

Using a router requires changing only one line of code in your existing application. Simply set your `model` parameter tequal to the router `Name` parameter assigned in the router creation step:

```diff app.py
def translate(text):
    """Translate text between Korean and English with automatic model selection."""
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
-         model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",  # Now using Claude through Martian
+         model="translation-router",  # Just change this one line to the name you used when creating a router to use your router
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a skilled Korean-English translator."},
            {"role": "user", "content": text}
        ],
        extra_body={
            "cost": "gpt-4o-mini"
        }
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()

# Example usage
result = translate("<translate>안녕하세요</translate>")
print(f"Translation: {result}")
```

Test to make sure it is working. Run the translator.
```bash

```

That's it! Your application now has intelligent model selection. The router will automatically:

* Select appropriate models for each request

* Optimize for both cost and quality

* Improve its selections over time based on feedback

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid Judge ID">
    Ensure the judge\_id exists and is configured for the correct language pair.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Invalid Baseline Model">
    Use only supported model names for the baseline\_model parameter.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Duplicate Names">
    Router names must be unique. Consider names like:

    * `ko-en-business-router`

    * `ko-en-technical-router`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next Steps

Now that you've created a translation router, you can:

1. Test routing with different constraints

2. Monitor translation quality

3. Store and analyze translations

4. Add quality judgements for optimization

<Note>
  You don't need to set up a judge or provide feedback to start using a router. Those features can be added later to further optimize performance.

title: 'Routing With A Cost Constraint'
description: 'Maximize quality for a given expected cost value'
---

Routing allows you to sit on the pareto frontier of performance. In other words, by routing, you can get the maximum possible performance at any level of cost. However, the pareto frontier is a curve which means there are many possible points for you to pick. We make it easy to pick the best point for your budget and business needs.

There are two different methods you can use to pick your point on the pareto curve.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cost" icon="money-bill">
    Maintain a specified budget for cost while increasing quality as much as possible within that budget.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Quality" icon="star">
    Maintain a specified level of quality while reducing cost as much as possible within that quality constraint.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Althought it is slightly counterintuitive, a user who cares about reducing cost as much as possible would want to use the quality parameter while a user who wants to increase quality as much as possible would want to use the cost parameter (and specify a max cost of infinity).

Right away, even with no training data and no judge, Martian can determine what model falls within your cost budget. Cost can be specified in two ways

Either it can be a 
`float` representing the `target cost of the request in dollars` 

or 

a `string` representing `a model which should cost similar to run the request as the router costs`

## Using the Cost Parameter
Let's set our cost parameter for the router.

```diff app.py
def translate(text):    
    response = router.completions.create(
        model="translation-router",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a skilled Korean-English translator."},
            {"role": "user", "content": text}
-       ]
+       ],
+       extra_body={
+           "cost": 0.0005 # The following result will be sent to the best performing model with an expected cost equal or below .005 cents or less
+           # "cost": "gpt-4o-mini" # The following result will be sent to the best performing model with an expected cost equal or below gpt-4o-mini price
+       }
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
```

<Note>
  Costs of models constantly change and new models are frequently released. Although it is tricky to stay on top of these prices, you're not limited to specific model price points with Martian. You can specify any cost value as your budget and even if there is no model which matches that cost, Martian automatically interpolates between model price points to maximize value.

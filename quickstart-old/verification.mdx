description: 'Learn how to systematically test all router and judge endpoints'
---

## Overview

The previous sections showed individual tests for each endpoint. Now let's combine them into a complete verification suite that:
- Tests all endpoints systematically
- Handles errors gracefully
- Reports progress clearly
- Maintains test dependencies

## Test Organization

The verification script combines the previous tests into a class:

```python
class EndpointTester:
    """Tests all Martian router and judge endpoints systematically."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize connection details
        load_dotenv()
        self.api_url = os.getenv("MARTIAN_API_URL")
        self.org_id = os.getenv("MARTIAN_ORG_ID")
        self.headers = {
            'accept': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': f'Bearer {os.getenv("MARTIAN_API_KEY")}',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
        
        # Store IDs for use across tests
        self.judge_id: Optional[str] = None
        self.router_id: Optional[str] = None
        self.version_id: Optional[str] = None
        self.request_response_id: Optional[str] = None
```

## Running All Tests

The `run_all_tests()` method executes all tests in the correct sequence:

```python
def run_all_tests(self):
    """Run all endpoint tests in sequence."""
    try:
        print("\nStarting endpoint tests...")
        
        # Step 1: Create judge
        self.judge_id = self.create_judge()
        print(f"✓ Created judge: {self.judge_id}")
        
        # Step 2: Verify judge
        self.verify_judge()
        print("✓ Verified judge details")
        
        # Step 3: Create router
        self.router_id = self.create_router()
        print(f"✓ Created router: {self.router_id}")
        
        # Step 4: Verify router
        self.verify_router()
        print("✓ Verified router details")
        
        # Step 5: Get version
        self.version_id = self.get_router_version()
        print(f"✓ Got version: {self.version_id}")
        
        # Step 6: Test routing
        self.test_routing()
        print("✓ Tested routing")
        
        # Step 7: Store response
        self.request_response_id = self.store_response()
        print(f"✓ Stored response: {self.request_response_id}")
        
        # Step 8: Add judgement
        self.add_judgement()
        print("✓ Added judgement")
        
        print("\nAll tests completed successfully! ✨")
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\n❌ Test failed: {str(e)}")
        raise
```

## Error Handling

Each test method includes comprehensive error handling:

<CodeGroup>
```python Validation Example
def verify_judge(self):
    """Verify judge details and listing."""
    if not self.judge_id:
        raise Exception("No judge ID available")
        
    # Get specific judge
    url = f'{self.api_url}/org/{self.org_id}/judges/{self.judge_id}'
    response = requests.get(url, headers=self.headers)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to get judge: {response.text}")
```

```python Testing Example
def test_routing(self):
    """Test routing with both cost and quality constraints."""
    if not all([self.router_id, self.version_id]):
        raise Exception("Missing router or version ID")
        
    url = f'{self.api_url}/org/{self.org_id}/routers/{self.router_id}/versions/{self.version_id}'
    
    response = requests.post(url, headers=self.headers, json=cost_request)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        raise Exception(f"Failed cost-constrained request: {response.text}")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Using the Test Suite

Run the complete test suite:

```python verification_test.py
from endpoint_tester import EndpointTester

if __name__ == "__main__":
    tester = EndpointTester()
    tester.run_all_tests()
```

<Note>
The test methods (`create_judge()`, `verify_router()`, etc.) use the same code shown in previous sections. See those sections for the detailed implementation of each test.
</Note>

## Common Test Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Dependencies">
    Tests must run in order because later tests depend on IDs from earlier tests.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Error States">
    Each test checks both successful operation and proper error handling.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="API Limits">
    Consider adding delays between tests if you hit rate limits.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Regular Testing">
    Run the verification suite regularly to catch issues early
  </Step>
  <Step title="Error Monitoring">
    Monitor test results to identify patterns in failures
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Expansion">
    Add your own test cases while maintaining the dependency chain
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

After implementing verification testing:
1. Set up automated test runs
2. Monitor test results
3. Add custom test cases
4. Implement test reporting

<Note>
Remember to clean up test resources if you're running tests frequently in a production environment.

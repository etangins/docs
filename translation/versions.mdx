## Version Overview
Both translation routers and judges use versioning to track improvements in translation quality and routing decisions over time.

## Judge Versions

### Listing Judge Versions
```python
def list_judge_versions(judge_id: str):
    """List all versions of a translation quality judge."""
    url = f'{API_URL}/org/{ORG_ID}/judges/{judge_id}/versions'
    response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS)
    versions = response.json()
    
    for version in versions['versions']:
        print(f"\nVersion ID: {version['version_id']}")
        print(f"Created at: {version['created_at']}")
        print(f"IAA Score: {version['iaa']}")  # Inter-annotator agreement score
    
    return versions
```

### Understanding Judge Version Details
Each translation judge version includes:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Version ID" icon="fingerprint">
    Unique identifier for the version
  </Card>
  <Card title="IAA Score" icon="chart-simple">
    Agreement score for translation quality metrics
  </Card>
  <Card title="Created Timestamp" icon="clock">
    When the version was created
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hash" icon="hashtag">
    Version content identifier
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Router Versions

### Listing Router Versions
```python
def list_router_versions(router_id: str):
    """List all versions of a translation router."""
    url = f'{API_URL}/org/{ORG_ID}/routers/{router_id}/versions'
    response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS)
    versions = response.json()
    
    for version in versions['versions']:
        print(f"\nVersion ID: {version['version_id']}")
        print(f"Created at: {version['created_at']}")
        print(f"Judge Version: {version['judge_version_id']}")
    
    return versions
```

### Understanding Router Version Details
Each translation router version includes:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Version ID" icon="fingerprint">
    Unique identifier for the version
  </Card>
  <Card title="Judge Version ID" icon="link">
    Associated translation judge version
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cost-Quality Points" icon="chart-scatter">
    Translation quality vs cost metrics
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hash" icon="hashtag">
    Version content identifier
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Best Practices
### Version Management
<Steps>
  <Step title="Track Version Pairs">
    Keep track of which translation judge and router versions work well together
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Performance">
    Track translation quality metrics across versions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Document Changes">
    Record improvements in translation quality or cost optimization
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Production Usage
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Version Stability">
    - Use specific version IDs in production
    - Test new versions with sample translations
    - Keep track of version compatibility
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Performance Monitoring">
    - Monitor translation quality metrics
    - Track cost per translation
    - Compare performance between versions
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Version Updates">
    - Plan updates when translation quality improves
    - Test new versions in staging
    - Maintain rollback procedures
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Issues
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Version Not Found" icon="circle-exclamation">
    ```python
    404: Version ID doesn't exist
    ```
    Verify version ID exists and is active
  </Card>
  <Card title="Incompatible Versions" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    ```python
    422: Judge version not compatible
    ```
    Ensure judge and router versions match
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Next Steps
After understanding versions, you can:
1. Use specific versions in production translation systems
2. Monitor translation quality across versions
3. Plan version updates based on quality improvements
4. Manage version compatibility

<Note>
  Always test new versions with a variety of translation examples before deploying to production.

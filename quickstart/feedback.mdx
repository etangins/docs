## Understanding Feedback
The system improves through:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Direct Judgements" icon="star">
    - Immediate quality scoring
    - Guide future routing decisions
    - Help identify optimal models
  </Card>
  <Card title="Request/Response Storage" icon="database">
    - Builds interaction history
    - Provides training data
    - Enables performance analysis
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Add feedback
To provide direct judgements, let's create a new file `add_feedback.py`:

```python add_feedback.py
from config import API_URL, ORG_ID, HEADERS
import requests

router_id = input("Enter router ID: ")
version_id = input("Enter version ID: ")
request_response_id = input("Enter request response ID: ")

# Add judgement
url = f'{API_URL}/org/{ORG_ID}/routers/{router_id}/versions/{version_id}/judgement'

data = {
    'request_response_id': request_response_id, 
    'judgement': {
        'score': 3,
        'rationale': 'The translation was accurate and preserved the meaning of the original text.'
    }
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=HEADERS, json=data)
print(response.json())
judgement_id = response.json()['judgement_id']
print(f"Added judgement with ID: {judgement_id}")
```

## Add request response pairs
To add request/response pairs, let's create a new file `add_request_and_response.py`:

```python add_request_and_response.py
from config import API_URL, ORG_ID, HEADERS
import requests

router_id = input("Enter router ID: ")
version_id = input("Enter version ID: ")

url = f'{API_URL}/org/{ORG_ID)}/routers/{router_id}/versions/{version_id}/response'

data = {
    'request': {
        'messages': [
            {"role": "system", "content": """You are a highly skilled translator with expertise in many languages. Your task is to:
                - Identify if the input is Korean or English
                - If Korean, translate to English
                - If English, translate to Korean
                - Preserve meaning, tone, and nuance
                - Maintain proper grammar and formality level
                """},
            {"role": "user", "content": "<translate>Tell me a joke?</translate>"}
        ]
    },
    'response': quality_response  # Use result from previous step
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=HEADERS, json=data)
request_response_id = response.json()['request_response_id']
print(f"\nStored response with ID: {request_response_id}")
```

## Understanding Response Formats

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Direct Feedback Response">
    ```json
    {
        "judgement_id": "judge_abc123...",
        "score": 0.95,
        "rationale": "Accurate and natural translation"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Stored Pair Response">
    ```json
    {
        "request_response_id": "req_resp_xyz789..."
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices
1. Provide feedback regularly to improve routing decisions
2. Include detailed rationale for low scores
3. Store important translations for future analysis
4. Use consistent scoring criteria

## Common Issues
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid Score Range">
    Ensure scores are between 0 and 1
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing Rationale">
    Always include explanatory rationale, especially for non-perfect scores
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Request Format">
    Verify message format matches OpenAI chat completion format
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next Steps
After implementing feedback:
1. Monitor router performance
2. Review feedback patterns
3. Track quality improvements
4. Analyze stored translations

<Note>
Remember to save response IDs for future reference. These can be useful for tracking improvements and analyzing patterns.

## Understanding Routers

Routers are intelligent decision-makers that select the optimal LLM for each request. They use judge feedback to balance cost and quality trade-offs.

    Route requests to meet quality requirements at minimum cost

</CardGroup>

## Creating Your First Router

<Note>
  Before creating a router, you need a judge ID from the previous step.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize Router Creation">
    ```python
    import requests
    import os
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    # Load environment variables
    load_dotenv()

    # API configuration
    url = f'{os.getenv("MARTIAN_API_URL")}/org/{os.getenv("MARTIAN_ORG_ID")}/routers'
    headers = {
        'accept': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {os.getenv("MARTIAN_API_KEY")}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Router Parameters">
    ```python
    data = {
        'name': 'Quality-Optimized Router',
        'description': 'Routes requests to optimize for quality while managing costs',
        'judge_id': 'your_judge_id_here',
        'baseline_model': 'gpt-4'
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Router">
    ```python
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    router_id = response.json()['router_id']
    print(f"Created router with ID: {router_id}")
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verifying Router Creation

After creating a router, verify its details:

```python
def get_router_details(router_id: str):
    """Retrieve details about a specific router."""
    url = f'{os.getenv("MARTIAN_API_URL")}/org/{os.getenv("MARTIAN_ORG_ID")}/routers/{router_id}'
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

details = get_router_details(router_id)
print(f"Name: {details['name']}")
print(f"Description: {details['description']}")
print(f"Judge ID: {details['judge_id']}")
print(f"Baseline Model: {details['baseline_model']}")
print(f"Created at: {details['created_at']}")
```

## Understanding Router Constraints

Routers accept two types of constraints:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cost Constraints" icon="dollar-sign">
    ```python
    # Numeric value (dollars)
    constraint = {'cost': 0.1}
    
    # Model name
    constraint = {'cost': 'gpt-3.5-turbo'}
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="Quality Constraints" icon="chart-line">
    ```python
    # Numeric value (0-1)
    constraint = {'quality': 0.8}
    
    # Model name
    constraint = {'quality': 'gpt-4'}
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Managing Multiple Routers

List all your routers:

```python
def list_routers():
    """List all routers in your organization."""
    url = f'{os.getenv("MARTIAN_API_URL")}/org/{os.getenv("MARTIAN_ORG_ID")}/routers'
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    return response.json()['routers']

routers = list_routers()
for router in routers:
    print(f"\nID: {router['router_id']}")
    print(f"Name: {router['name']}")
    print(f"Description: {router['description']}")
```

## Understanding Baseline Models

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is a Baseline Model?">
    The baseline model serves as:
    - A quality benchmark
    - A fallback option
    - A starting point for optimization
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Choosing a Baseline">
    Common choices include:
    - `gpt-4`: High quality, higher cost
    - `gpt-3.5-turbo`: Good balance of quality and cost
    - `gpt-4-turbo`: Latest model with improved capabilities
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Cost-Quality Trade-offs

Routers optimize the trade-off between cost and quality:

<Frame>
  ```mermaid
  scatter
    title Cost vs Quality Trade-off
    x-axis Quality [0-1]
    y-axis Cost ($)
    line-0: 0.7,0.02 "GPT-3.5"
    line-1: 0.85,0.06 "GPT-4"
    line-2: 0.95,0.12 "GPT-4-32k"
  ```
</Frame>

## Best Practices

### Router Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Appropriate Baseline">
    Select a baseline model that matches your minimum quality requirements
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Clear Objectives">
    Decide whether to optimize for:
    - Minimum cost with quality threshold
    - Maximum quality within budget
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Performance">
    Regularly check:
    - Cost efficiency
    - Quality metrics
    - Response times
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Constraint Selection

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cost-Based Routing" icon="money-bill-trend-up">
    Use when:
    - Budget is primary concern
    - Quality requirements are flexible
    - High request volume
  </Card>
  <Card title="Quality-Based Routing" icon="ranking-star">
    Use when:
    - Quality is critical
    - Budget is flexible
    - Specific quality threshold needed
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid Judge ID">
    Ensure the judge_id exists and is correctly formatted. A 404 error indicates the judge wasn't found.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Invalid Baseline Model">
    Use only supported model names for the baseline_model parameter. Invalid models result in a 422 error.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Duplicate Names">
    Router names must be unique within your organization. Duplicate names cause a 409 Conflict error.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next Steps

Now that you've created a router, you can:
1. Test routing with different constraints
2. Monitor performance metrics
3. Store and analyze responses
4. Add judgements for optimization

<Note>
  Remember to record your router_id for use in subsequent operations.

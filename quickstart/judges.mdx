## Understanding Judges

A judge is the cornerstone of the Martian system. It defines what "good" looks like for your use case and provides consistent quality metrics that guide routing decisions.

## Creating Your First Judge

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize Judge Creation">
    ```python
    # Load environment variables
    load_dotenv()

    # API configuration
    url = f'{os.getenv("MARTIAN_API_URL")}/org/{os.getenv("MARTIAN_ORG_ID")}/judges'
    headers = {
        'accept': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {os.getenv("MARTIAN_API_KEY")}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Judge Parameters">
    ```python
    data = {
        'name': 'Quality Assessment Judge',
        'description': 'Evaluates response quality based on accuracy and completeness'
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Judge">
    ```python
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    judge_id = response.json()['judge_id']
    print(f"Created judge with ID: {judge_id}")
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Save your `judge_id` for later use when creating routers and storing judgements.
</Note>

## Verifying Judge Creation

After creating a judge, verify its details:

```python
def get_judge_details(judge_id: str):
    """Retrieve details about a specific judge."""
    url = f'{os.getenv("MARTIAN_API_URL")}/org/{os.getenv("MARTIAN_ORG_ID")}/judges/{judge_id}'
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

details = get_judge_details(judge_id)
print(f"Name: {details['name']}")
print(f"Description: {details['description']}")
print(f"Created at: {details['created_at']}")
print(f"Latest version: {details['latest']}")
```

## Managing Multiple Judges

List all your judges:

```python
def list_judges():
    """List all judges in your organization."""
    url = f'{os.getenv("MARTIAN_API_URL")}/org/{os.getenv("MARTIAN_ORG_ID")}/judges'
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    return response.json()['judges']

judges = list_judges()
for judge in judges:
    print(f"\nID: {judge['judge_id']}")
    print(f"Name: {judge['name']}")
    print(f"Description: {judge['description']}")
```

## Understanding Judge Versions

Each judge maintains versions to track improvements over time:

```python
def get_judge_versions(judge_id: str):
    """List all versions of a specific judge."""
    url = f'{os.getenv("MARTIAN_API_URL")}/org/{os.getenv("MARTIAN_ORG_ID")}/judges/{judge_id}/versions'
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    return response.json()['versions']

versions = get_judge_versions(judge_id)
for version in versions:
    print(f"\nVersion ID: {version['version_id']}")
    print(f"Created at: {version['created_at']}")
    print(f"IAA Score: {version['iaa']}")
```

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Descriptive Names">
    Use names that clearly indicate the judge's purpose:
    - `translation-accuracy-judge`
    - `code-quality-judge`
    - `brand-voice-judge`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Detailed Descriptions">
    Include in your description:
    - Quality metrics being evaluated
    - Expected use cases
    - Any specific criteria
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Quality Metrics

Consider these factors when defining quality:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Accuracy" icon="bullseye">
    How correct and precise are the responses?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Relevance" icon="arrows-to-dot">
    How well do responses address the query?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Completeness" icon="square-check">
    Are all aspects of the query addressed?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistency" icon="equals">
    Are similar queries handled similarly?
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Duplicate Names">
    Each judge must have a unique name within your organization. Trying to create a judge with a duplicate name will result in a 409 Conflict error.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Invalid Characters">
    Judge names should only contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing Description">
    While descriptions can be brief, they must be provided. A clear description helps identify the judge's purpose.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next Steps

Now that you've created a judge, you can:
1. Create a router that uses your judge
2. Start evaluating responses
3. Store and analyze judgements

<Note>
  For optimal routing performance, ensure your judge consistently evaluates similar responses with similar scores.

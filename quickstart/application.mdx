Let's start with a simple translation application. We'll first set up our environment and then create a basic translator that we'll later optimize using Martian's routing system.

## Project Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Project Directory">
    ```bash
    mkdir martian-translator
    cd martian-translator
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clone the Starter Repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/withmartian/routing-quickstart.git
    cd routing-quickstart
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create and Activate Virtual Environment">
    For Unix/macOS:
    ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    
    For Windows:
    ```batch
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    Confirm that your Githbub repo contains the following requirements.txt file:

    ```txt requirements.txt
    openai==1.59.3
    python-dotenv==1.0.1
    requests==2.28.2
    ```

    Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Environment Variables">
    Your Github repo should contain an example.env file.
    
    Go ahead and create a .env file modeled after the example.env file:

    ```txt .env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Make sure to change `your_api_key_here` to your actual OpenAI API key which can be found at https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys.
</Note>

## Basic Translation App

Here's our starting application. Create a new file with the following code:

```python app.py
from openai import OpenAI
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Configure OpenAI client
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

def translate(text):
    """Translate text between Korean and English."""
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",  # Fixed model for all translations
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": """You are a highly skilled translator with expertise in many languages. Your task is to:
                - Identify if the input is Korean or English
                - If Korean, translate to English
                - If English, translate to Korean
                - Preserve meaning, tone, and nuance
                - Maintain proper grammar and formality level
                """},
            {"role": "user", "content": text}
        ]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    while True:
        text = input("\nEnter text to translate (or 'q' to quit): ")
        if text.lower() == 'q':
            break
            
        result = translate(text)
        print(f"\nTranslation: {result}")
```

## Test the Application

1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated:<CodeGroup>
   <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Unix/macOS">
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Windows">
        ```batch
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

3. Run the translator:

   ```bash
       python app.py
   ```

## Current Limitations from Using OpenAI Instead of Martian

This basic implementation works but has some drawbacks:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Fixed Model" icon="lock">
    Always uses GPT-4o-Mini, even for simple translations
  </Card>

  <Card title="Cost Inefficient" icon="money-bill">
    No way to optimize for cost vs quality
  </Card>

  <Card title="No Quality Metrics" icon="chart-line">
    Can't track or improve translation quality
  </Card>

  <Card title="No Feedback Loop" icon="rotate">
    Doesn't learn from past translations
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

In the following sections, we'll modify this application to use Martian's router system, which will help us:

* Route requests to appropriate models based on needs

* Optimize for cost and quality

* Collect and use quality feedback

* Monitor and improve translation performance

<Note>
  Remember to never commit your .env file to version control. Add it to your .gitignore file to prevent accidental exposure of your API key.

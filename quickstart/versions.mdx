## Understanding Router Versions
Router versions represent different states of your router's optimization as it learns from feedback. When you create a router with the id `abc-123-456-789`, new versions will automatically be created over time as:
- `abc-123-456-789:1`
- `abc-123-456-789:2`
- `abc-123-456-789:3`
And so on.

Each version contains:
- A unique version ID and name
- Performance metrics
- Associated judge version

If you want to always use the latest version of the router, you can simply specify `translation-router` and the version of the router will be automatically switched to the latest version whenever a new version is released.

## Managing Versions

Let's create a new file called `list_router_versions.py` and add the following code block to it to list router versions

<Steps>
  <Step title="List Router Versions">
    ```python list_router_versions.py
    from config import API_URL, ORG_ID, HEADERS
    import requests
    
    router_id = input("Enter router ID: ")
    
    url = f'{API_URL}/org/{ORG_ID}/routers/{router_id}/versions'
    response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS)
    print(response.json())
    ```
  </Step>

  Now let's create a file called `get_router_version_details.py` and add the following code block to it to get version details of a router
  <Step title="Get Version Details">
    ```python get_router_version_details.py
    from config import API_URL, ORG_ID, HEADERS
    import requests
    
    router_id = input("Enter router ID: ")
    version_id = input("Enter version ID: ")
    
    url = f'{API_URL}/org/{ORG_ID}/routers/{router_id}/versions/{version_id}'
    response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS)
    details = response.json()
    print(details)
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get router details">

  Now let's create a file called `view_router.py` and add the following code block to it to get router details of a router.
    ```python view_router.py
    from config import API_URL, ORG_ID, HEADERS
    import requests
    
    url = f'{API_URL}/org/{ORG_ID}/routers'
    
    def get_router_details(router_id: str):
        """Retrieve details about a specific translation router."""
        url = f'{API_URL}/org/{ORG_ID}/routers/{router_id}'
        response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS)
        return response.json()
    
    router_id = input("Enter router ID: ")
    details = get_router_details(router_id)
    print(f"Name: {details['name']}")
    print(f"Description: {details['description']}")
    print(f"Judge ID: {details['judge_id']}")
    print(f"Baseline Model: {details['baseline_model']}")
    print(f"Created at: {details['created_at']}")
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
## Version Selection
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Using Latest Version">
    Always use the base router name to get the latest version:
    ```python basic_translator.py
    model="abc-123-456-789"  # Always uses latest version
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Using Specific Version">
    Use numbered versions for consistency:
    ```python basic_translator.py
    model="abc-123-456-789:1"  # Always uses version 1
    model="abc-123-456-789:2"  # Always uses version 2
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Version Migration">
    Test new versions before switching production traffic:
    ```python basic_translator.py
    # Test new version
    result = translate("테스트", "abc-123-456-789:2")
    
    # If satisfied, switch to using latest
    result = translate("테스트", "abc-123-456-789")
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
<Note>
  New versions are created automatically as your router learns. Monitor performance metrics to decide when to upgrade.
</Note>
## Troubleshooting
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid Version">
    Check that the version slug exists and is correctly formatted
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Performance Regression">
    Compare cost-quality points with previous versions
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing Data">
    Ensure sufficient feedback data for meaningful comparisons
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
## Next Steps
After understanding versions:
1. Set up version monitoring
2. Create a version upgrade strategy
3. Integrate version management into your CI/CD
4. Track version performance metrics
<Note>
  Remember to test new versions thoroughly before using them in production.

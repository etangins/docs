Adding a Martian router to your application is simple and provides immediate benefits. Let's modify our translation app to use intelligent model selection.

## Create Your First Router
Creating a router takes just a few lines of code:

```python
from martian import Router

# Create a router - only needs to be done once
router = Router.create(
    name="translation-router",
    description="Routes translation requests to optimal models"
)

# Save this ID for future use
print(f"Created router with ID: {router.id}")
```

## Use the Router
Update your translation function to use the router:

```python
def translate(text):
    """Translate text between Korean and English with automatic model selection."""
    router = Router(router_id="your_router_id")
    
    response = router.completions.create(
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a skilled Korean-English translator."},
            {"role": "user", "content": text}
        ]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()

# Example usage
result = translate("안녕하세요")
print(f"Translation: {result}")
```

That's it! Your application now has intelligent model selection. The router will automatically:
- Select appropriate models for each request
- Optimize for both cost and quality
- Improve its selections over time based on feedback

<Note>
  You don't need to set up a judge or provide feedback to start using a router. Those features can be added later to further optimize performance.

While routers work well with basic feedback, you can further optimize performance by creating a judge that defines specific quality criteria for your use case.

## What is a Judge?
A judge helps your router understand what "good" means for your specific application. For translation, this might include:
- Translation accuracy
- Grammar correctness
- Tone preservation
- Technical terminology usage

## Creating a Judge
Create a judge to define your quality criteria:

```python
from martian import Judge

# Create a judge for your specific needs
judge = Judge.create(
    name="translation-judge",
    description="Evaluates Korean-English translation quality"
)

# Update your router to use this judge
router = Router.create(
    name="translation-router",
    description="Routes translation requests",
    judge_id=judge.id  # Connect judge to router
)
```

## Enhanced Performance
With a judge, your router can:
- Better understand your quality requirements
- Make more accurate model selections
- Optimize for your specific use case

<Note>
  Judges are optional but can improve router performance when you have specific quality requirements. Start with basic feedback and add a judge when you need more precise quality optimization.
